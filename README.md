# kill_himan3exe
This is a Python script that creates an exe. The exe looks for a hotkey combination and kills the Hitman3.exe task.

You must have Python installed on your system for this script to work. You can get Python by following these instructions: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10

Download and unzip the file under Releases. Once downloaded, you can edit the "config.txt" file to change the hotkey and game that you want to kill.

To install just run the "install_the_things.bat" file. This will install all the Python dependencies needed for the script to work.

Run the Kill_Hitman3.exe file after the installation. It will then listen for your hotkey presses and kill ONLY Hitman3.exe when pressed. It will sit in your system tray and can be closed from there.
